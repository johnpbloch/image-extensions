## Image Extensions

Image extensions is a plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org). It will allow you to append image extensions (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.gif`) to the end of your shortlinks as an alias. For example, `http://sho.rt/w4Je` could have an image extension added and look like `http://sho.rt/w4Je.jpg`.

## (In)frequently Asked Questions

##### Q: What extensions are supported?
A: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.gif`. Sorry, no bitmap love.

##### Q: Um... why?
A: Because some people are silly and assume that no URLs on the internet could possibly redirect somewhere and if it doesn't have the extension they want, they treat it differently by making it drink from the bitmap water fountain.

## Installation

Come on, if you have an installation of YOURLS running, you ought to either have enough technical proficiency or know someone who does not to need to ask this question.

The first rule of YOURLS club is you don't tell people how to install plugins.

Just kidding. [Here's the documentation](http://code.google.com/p/yourls/wiki/Plugins#Wrapping_it_up:_your_first_plugin).
